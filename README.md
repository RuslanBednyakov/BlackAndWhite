BlackAndWhite
Welcome to my website. This is my first time making something like this. At the moment i'm just starting my long-long road 
in the world of web-development.


Installation
Firstly make sure that you have latest version of browser installed. Next clone this repo https://github.com/RuslanBednyakov/BlackAndWhite.git. You can do this by going into your shell of choice and entering

git clone https://github.com/RuslanBednyakov/BlackAndWhite.git
then change into that folder

Contribute
I'll be very happy for any input and potential contributions for this project.

Firstly raise an issue. Then if you are assigned to that issue fork the repo, make your edits and make a pull request.

I hope you enjoy my first work :)
